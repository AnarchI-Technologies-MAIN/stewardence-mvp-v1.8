## Status

Phase 23 is complete.

## Local release-gate evidence

- Coverage: 88.43%, above the required 80% threshold.
- Initial full-suite attempt reached 398 passed with 15 setup errors caused by a Windows temp-directory permission problem at `C:\Users\alexg\AppData\Local\Temp\pytest-of-alexg`.
- The suite was rerun with an isolated accessible temp root and all 413 tests passed.
- Ruff lint: passed.
- Ruff format check: 206 files already formatted.

Current Railway production services were verified running at commit `a012afca25edc90161e24299320819659cc8c3d4` with application sleep disabled for web, worker, renderer, and Postgres.

## Backup evidence

Phase 20 already records PITR active/current, encrypted off-platform logical backup, and a clean restore drill. Scheduled Railway volume backups remain plan-gated on the current trial plan and are not claimed enabled.

## Freeze disposition

Phase 23 is complete, but full freeze remains blocked by the explicit Phase 20 scheduled Railway volume-backup control unless the founder approves the required billing/plan change or amends that specific gate.
